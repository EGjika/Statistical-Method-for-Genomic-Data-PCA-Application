# Statistical-Method-for-Genomic-Data-PCA-Application
In this repository is conducted differentially expression analysis to identify genes which are differentially expressed between cancer and healthy patients using limma package from Bioconductor and R. A Principal Component Analysis is conducted to understand the number of dimensions which explain more than 80% of the variance.  Cluster Analysis.

Bioconductor is used and additional packages from it. The main aim is to show how we may work with microarray data and perform PCA analysis. 
The approach is used on real research data and the results seem to be promissing.
